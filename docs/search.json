    "text": "I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to explore a wide range of industries that have captured my interest. My work experience began with a three-year stint at a fast-food restaurant, where I learned the value of loyalty and dedication. In between those three years, I worked as a tutor at a local middle school, hoping to explore a career in education and later as an intern at the Oregon Environmental Council to pursue my interest in environmental justice.\nFollowing my internship, I worked as an oral health educator assistant at the Boys & Girls Club, Health and Dental Services Center. I loved being in scrubs every day and felt like I was making a personal difference in the lives of the students we served. This experience led me to pursue a career in oral healthcare, where I provided chairside dental care as a dental assistant. However, during the pandemic, I began feeling burnt out and decided to return to community college to fulfill necessary prerequisites for dental school.\nWhile I was unsure of my next step, I made the difficult decision to leave my dental assisting job after thoughtful consideration. I then spent three months in Mexico connecting with my roots. It was during this time that I received an email informing me that I had been awarded a scholarship that would cover my tuition and allow me to transfer to Western Oregon University. It was here that I fell in love with my public health education classes, and shortly after my first term, I declared myself a public health major.\nThroughout my professional journey, I have honed my skills in communication, easily adapting to new environments, and taking on leadership roles with enthusiasm. Public speaking has been a consistent part of many of my positions, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. I am excited to continue growing and learning in my future endeavors."

    "section": "Oregon’s Health at a National Scale",
    "text": "Oregon’s Health at a National Scale\n\nExploring the US Census\nMy parents chose Oregon as their home state almost 25 years ago, after migrating around the United States for some time, and I am so grateful they did. I was born and raised in Oregon and appreciate the diversity of each region, which is why I chose to base my national research on Oregon.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.a.\n\n\nThese statistics are essential to understand disease development. Two other characteristics I decided to include in my table were data for foreign-born populations with and without U.S. citizenship, and the language spoken at home, which is based on the population aged 5 and up. These characteristics are essential for health professionals because undocumented immigrants who have not naturalized in the United States are barred from participating in most federal healthcare programs, limiting their access to accessible and affordable healthcare. It is also crucial for health professionals to be aware that many people do not speak or practice English at home; therefore, without the assistance of a (paid) interpreter, the person receiving care may be misinformed or misdiagnosed when receiving and exchanging medical documents.\n\n\nUsing the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is one of the United States’ pioneers in health-related telephone survey systems, collecting state data on U.S. residents’ health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services. BRFSS started in 1984 working within 15 states and has now expanded through all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories.\nThe data collected from BRFSS would be useful to me as I pursue a public health career because by using these tools I would be able to assist with the implementation of disease prevention and health promotion activities, and the monitoring of trends.\nState health departments use in-house interviewers or contract with telephone call centers or universities to conduct the BRFSS surveys throughout the year. The states use a standardized core questionnaire, optional modules, and questions specific to their state. The survey is conducted on both land-lines and cell phones using “Random Digit Dialing” (RDD) techniques.\nBRFSS data runs the risk of information, reporting bias, specifically, socially desirable responses because people who are surveyed could feel compelled to lie to avoid embarrassing themselves.\n\nBreakdown of the hypertension data in Oregon by gender, age, race, and education.\nAccording to the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for Oregon as of 2021, 30.9% of adults have been told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure. In the United States, 32.2% of adults have been told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure, compared to Oregon, the national average is 1.3% higher.\n\n\n\nFigure 3_D_ii\n\n\n\nOregon Oral Health and BMI Data from the BRFSS Questionnaires\nThe topic I chose for the state of Oregon, based on the 2020 data, was about oral health; adults that have had any permanent teeth extracted. The question asked in the BRFSS questionnaires was specifically worded as “Not including teeth lost for injury or orthodontics, how many of your permanent teeth have been removed because of tooth decay or gum disease?”. In Oregon, based on the 2020 data, 38.6% of adults have had at least one or more permanent teeth extracted. In the US, 40.2% of adults have had at least one or more permanent teeth extracted. Oregon is below the US benchmark with only a 1.6% difference.\n\n\n\nFigure 3_D_iii_1\n\n\nIn 2020, the percentage of adults that have had any permanent teeth extracted due to tooth decay or gum disease in the state of Oregon showed many differences but similarities as well. Both males and females were pretty equal, males sitting at 38.5% whereas females were at 38.7%, both males and females were similarly susceptible to tooth extraction. Those aged 65 and over were the most susceptible to tooth extraction with a percentage of 61.7%, between ages, the percentage has a linear relationship because the older you get the more likely you are to get teeth removed. Looking at the race and ethnic groups, American Indians / Alaskan Natives were the most susceptible to getting teeth extracted with the highest percentage of 48.5. All other races and ethnic groups were below 40%.\nThe second topic I chose to look further into for the state of Oregon, based on the 2021 data, was weight classification by Body Mass Index (BMI). To categorize the data there were two separate questions asked and based on the answers for each person, their BMI was calculated. The questions asked in the BRFSS Questionnaires were specifically worded as “About how much do you weigh without shoes? About how tall are you without shoes?”. In Oregon, based on the 2021 data, 65.1% of adults are classified as obese or overweight. In the US, 68.2% of adults are classified as obese or overweight.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.D.iii.2\n\n\nIn 2021, there wasn’t data available for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, multiracial and Hispanic races and ethnic groups who could be underweight based on their BMI. Combined, the percentage of males who are overweight or obese is greater than the percentage of females who are overweight and obese, making males more susceptible to a higher BMI. From ages 18-24, 55.5% were at a normal BMI but the relationship between BMI has a consistent linear relationship in the data table because the BMI increases as age increases. Between racial and ethnic groups, American Indians/Alaskan Natives are the most susceptible to becoming obese or overweight. Overall, I found the BRFSS website to be very interesting, the BRFSS Prevalence & Trends Data Is such a useful tool for people who are curious about the prevalence of different health factors. It’s cool to see the data dating back to 1999. I found that the percentage of males and females in Oregon having had at least one tooth or more removed because of tooth decay or gum disease has greatly decreased since 1999. The percentage for females based on 2020 data was 38.7 and in 1999 it was 51.7. For males, it was 38.5 in 2020, and 54.0 in 1999.\n\n\n\n\nNavigating the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and Roadmaps\nOne of the main findings that I thought was interesting was the geographic differences in school funding have a correlation dating back to the history of racial discrimination, violence, and exclusion. The summary listed that many counties in the Western and Southern U.S. do not spend enough money on the students for them to achieve national average test scores. It was found that counties with a great amount of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian / Alaska Native populations are experiencing funding deficits. I recently finished listening to the “Nice White Parents” podcast by Chana Joffe-Walt. Being a first-generation student, mixed with the fact that I went to predominantly white (private) schools, I honestly don’t have much exposure to how the public school system works. I uncovered some of my own biases from listening to the stories of the continuous systemic oppression towards the students who don’t fit in the “box” of school policymakers and how nothing is done to help revive curricula that work for the students.\nI can see these data being susceptible to information, recall, can’t remember bias. During the data collection there is a possibility for an error in the classification of study participants’ exposure or outcome status.\n\nPremature Death Health Outcome in Oregon\nPremature death is measured as the years of life lost for those under 75 years of age per 100,000 people. The County Health Rankings sourced its data from the National Center for Health Statistics, specifically, the Mortality File. The 2022 reporting represents the data from 2018 through 2020. Based on the 2022 reporting representing data from 2018 through 2020, out of all the counties in Oregon, 4 counties did not have any data available - which were all rural. Jefferson County had the most years of life lost, 10,700 years, 81.9 of those years stemming from malignant neoplasms, a cancerous tumor. Besides being ranked as the #1 healthiest county, Benton County had the lowest number of years of life lost in deaths of people under age 75, per 100,000 people, totaling to only 4,000 people. The leading cause of those years lost was also malignant neoplasms. As a whole, the state of Oregon lost an average of 6,100 years of life which is just a bit below the United States average of 7,300 years of life.\n\n\nHealth-related measures in Rural vs. Urban Counties in Oregon\nAccording to the 2020 Census data the rural county I explored, Gilliam County, has a population density of 1.7 people per square mile. For the urban county, I explored Washington County, the population density is 828.9 people per square mile.\nI chose to investigate diabetes prevalence of adults 20 years and older, the measure was defined by only including those who reported being diagnosed with diabetes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.D.iii\n\n\nI choose Gilliam county as my rural exploration and Washington County as my urban exploration. I thought there would be a great difference between these two counties because Washington County includes the Portland metropolitan area. The population density is high and with the huge amount of promotion I’ve seen of health initiatives throughout the major cities of Washington County, I thought the prevalence of adults with diagnosed diabetes was going to be low in comparison to a rural county and the state of Oregon. Every google question I looked up trying to find whether a rural county or an urban county was more prevalent to diabetes contradicted itself. Some reports stated urban counties as most prevalent in diabetes because of big access to fast food and other reports stated urban counties are least prevalent in diabetes because of all the walking one has to do to get around to places. Across the board, the two counties and the state of Oregon had a very close relationship and I’m surprised to know that the rural county I chose, Gilliam, is only 1% more prevalent than the urban county and Oregon."

    "text": "From State to County\n\nDissecting the Oregon Healthy Teens Survey\nIn 2017, 14,852 8th graders and 11,895 11th graders were surveyed. In the 2019 survey, 43,783 8th graders were enrolled but only 15,256 were valid surveys, 42,949 enrolled 11th but only 12,834 were valid surveys. The numbers between Polk County compared to the state of Oregon as a whole are quite similar. In 2019, the majority of 8th graders, 47%, and 11th graders, 50%, identified as White. In Oregon as a whole this is also true, the majority of 8th graders, 56.7%, and 11th graders, 61.4%, also identified as White.\nI compared the access to health care for the teens in Polk county to the teens in the State of Oregon as a whole. The three measurements indicate where there can be a lack of a certain factor that could be adjusted to ensure there is health equity; lack of routine care, unmet needs in the last 12 months, and emergency room or urgent care visits for physical or mental health care need in the past 12 months. Under the lack of routine care, I specifically looked at the teens reporting no dental check-ups, teeth cleaning, or exams in over a year. State of Oregon 8th graders note 13.2% of those reporting hadn’t met this need and 18.3% of 11th graders hadn’t met this need either. The percentages for Polk county are just as high. 18.1% of Polk 8th graders reported they had not been able to see a dentist for a check-up, cleaning, or exam and 16.3% of 11th graders reported this unmet need as well. This means that those reporting the unmet need do not currently have the chance to live up to their full health potential. Having been a dental assistant I understand that many teens face some sort of dental anxiety or just come from a family that does not find oral health care important since the influences on both the health of a person and a population are social determinants and the environments in which individuals choose to live, work, learn, and play. Overall I’m thinking about the negative impact on their health and quality of life the teens with the unmet need might face in the future and the debt that may come along with it if their last resort is to go to the emergency room due to unmet preventative dental care.\n\nSchool Based Health Centers health indicator\nThe health indicator I was most interested in was students reporting their school has a School-Based Health Center and the students reporting having used the School-Based Health Center one or more times in the past 12 months out of students attending schools with school-based health centers.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.B.iv.1 in conjunction with Figure 5.B.iv.2\n\n\nIn Polk County, only 19.8% of the students reporting stated that their school has a School-Based Health center, and out of those students at schools with SBHC, only there wasn’t any data reported for any 8th graders using the SBHC’s at their schools. For the State of Oregon, 31% of 8th-grade students reported having an SBHC and 24.5% of those students reported using the SBHC in the last 12 months. The numbers were a lot bigger for both Polk County and the State of Oregon among 11th graders. 60.9% of 11th graders in Polk County reported their school having an SBHC, of those, 36.7% reported having used the SBHC at least once in the last 12 months. In comparison to the State of Oregon, 47.6% reported having an SBHC and 29% reported having used the SBHC at least once."

    "section": "Mexico and the Global Health Landscape",
    "text": "Mexico and the Global Health Landscape\n\nUtilizing the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)\nI chose to base my international research off of Mexico because I was recently there from August 2022 to October 2022 and, unfortunately, my cousin broke her arm on our day trip into the city, an hour away from our home, since we were in a city the nearest urgent care was just a few minutes away by car, but because it was a private office, the cost of just getting x-rays and basic care for the fracture was nearly a year’s worth of my uncle’s salary.\nThe University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is in charge of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), which was initiated in the early 1990s. It has expanded over the past 20 years into a global network of approximately 5,500 researchers, and its estimates are updated every year. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is an attempt to explore a thorough picture of changes in health, including mortality and disability across nations, time, age, and sex. This can be helpful for decision-makers, health workers, and researchers in different countries to compare their countries’ health progress to that of other countries and to comprehend the primary causes of health loss that could potentially be avoided.\nBy utilizing the Country Profiles section, we can examine figures presented in Mexico’s country profile and interpret their meaning. I chose the figure titled “What is the fertility trend now and in the future?”. The main point is to compare the fertility rate between Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and at a global status. It represents the fertility rate based on the average number of children a woman delivers over her lifetime. The data begins in 1990 and estimates the fertility rate through 2100. The horizontal axis is the exposure measured as years starting at 1990 through 2100. The vertical axis is the outcome which is the total fertility rate. Within the data of Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, and globally, the fertility rate seems to be declining at a steady pace. The second figure I chose was titled “What is the mortality trend in the under-5 and under-1 age groups?”. The main point is to represent the mortality rate of those under 5 years old and those under 1 year old. The data begins in 1990 and estimates the fertility rate through 2100. The horizontal axis is the exposure measured as years starting 1990 through 2019. The vertical axis is measured as deaths per 1,000 live births. Since 1990, the mortality trend for both, those under 5 and those under 1 have steadily decreased through 2018.\n\nReplicating the Life Expectancy line graph for Mexico from 1990 to 2100\n\n\n\nFigure Figure 6.C.ii\n\n\n\n\nExamining the visual representation of data\nI compared the data of Mexico focusing on both males and females cumulatively, globally, high income, the Central American region as a whole, and the country of Guatemala. The life expectancy at birth from Central America was 71.17 in 1990 and by 2040 is projected to increase to 78.58 years. This is very similar to the life expectancy in Mexico, in 1990 it was 71.62 and is now projected to increase to 78.26 by 2040. In comparison to the life expectancy at birth in Guatemala, in 1990 it was 64.63 but is projected to increase to 76.02 by 2040, a bit below Mexico and the projected estimate of that region but it’s not far behind. There is a big difference comparing Mexico, and Guatemala as well as Central America, to high-income major regions. In 1990 the life expectancy was 74 and is expected to steadily increase to 82.4 by 2040. Globally though, Mexico is doing a bit better than the earth’s expected projection. In 1990 the life expectancy was 65.1 and is projected to increase to 76.9 by 2040. Overall I would rank Mexico into the 3rd state of the epidemiological transition, where they are facing the receding pandemics of heart disease, accounting for 11.19% of the total deaths, diabetes accounting for 11.81% of total deaths, and chronic kidney disease accounting for 11.57% of total deaths.\nI looked at the National Health Accounts (NHA) Visualization world map. I chose to look a bit further into Germany because I have relatives who immigrated from Mexico to Germany over 30 years ago. I keep close contact with my family in Germany and my relatives who are the same age as me have come to visit Oregon plenty of times love it here, but have stated they would never try to make a life here because the government doesn’t care about its people the way Germany does. Germany has many measures in place to help its citizens live up to their full health potential. Based on the 2009 data, the federal government finances 77% of healthcare."

    "title": "Primary Research Group Project: Understanding Attitudes and Behaviors Toward Sugary Beverages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To better understand the consumption of sugary beverages in our community and assess nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to these drinks, a total of 12 questions were asked to participants. The survey included a variety of questions relating to demographic circumstances, mainly pertaining to age, educational attainment, and gender identity. Our research group, consisting of five members, looked at potential reasons why a person might choose the beverage they do. We also looked into how often the respondents drank sweetened versus unsweetened beverages so that we could understand sugar consumption. This kind of information that was gathered is important because it shows us the relationship that different age groups have with sugary beverages compared to water and how it affects what they drink. We could use this information to provide educational opportunities around beverages and the importance of understanding the effects of sugary drinks.\n\n\n\nA survey was created in Google Forms, made up of 10 multiple choice questions and 2 short answer questions. Our group gathered questions from previous questionnaires from reliable sources that specifically addressed nutrition and health concerns. Initially, each member contributed 12 questions each, and together we refined and narrowed them down to a final set of 12 questions total. Additionally, we made necessary adjustments to ensure that the wording of the questions was easily understandable for respondents. All these questions were put in a Google Document and cited the data that was pulled from other professional surveys. All of the information from the Google Document was inputted directly into a Google Form, the initial survey instrument was edited and put through a test run by our own group members before it was finalized by the Google Form coordinator. We had to collect a minimum of 50 responses. Each member took responsibility for sharing the Google Form link to ensure that we reached and exceeded the minimum response goal. The survey was open from May 5, 2023, and closed on May 7, 2023. After giving our respondents five days to complete the survey, we received 82 total responses, but one of those 82 did not agree to the initial consent form. Overall, a total of 81 individuals participated in our survey, their responses were collected and provided important information to make our conclusions.\n\n\n\n![Figure 3.D.iii.2](Figure_3D_iii_2%20Large.jpeg)\nTable 1 discusses the demographic characteristics of the participants in the survey. The questions were answered similarly. Over half of the participants identified as Cisgender Female (58.7%). One-third of the participants identified as Cisgender Male (30.0%). There was a small number of persons identified as Non-Binary (3.7%) and Transgender Female (1.2%). There was also a small percentage of people who did not say what their gender identity is (6.3%). A majority of people were in the age ranges of 21-24 (35.8%), 30 or older (28.4%) or 18-20 (23.5%). 8.6% of participants were between the ages of 25-29 and 3.7% of participants were under the age of 18. This table also discusses the education levels. A majority of the participants had completed some college or technical training (43.2%) or a completion of a Bachelor’s degree (29.6%). 11.1% of participants had a completion of a High School Diploma or a GED and 12.3% have an Advanced Degree. A very small percentage of participants had no completion of high school (3.7%).\n\n\nTo start our survey we asked a few questions regarding our respondents’ demographics. We asked them to answer which gender identity they identified as. We specifically asked about gender identity rather than sex because people identify more than what sex they were assigned at birth and felt by giving more options than simply male or female, we were able to be inclusive to everyone participating in our survey. The majority of respondents were cisgender females representing nearly 60% of our survey. Cisgender males represented 30%, with the remaining being made up of either transgender females, non-binary, or people who would rather not say.\n\n\n\nWe also wanted to get the age of those participating in our survey. We offered several age ranges with a conscious decision to group those below and those over the age of 21 into different categories knowing we would be asking a question regarding alcohol consumption in our survey. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of our respondents, accounting for nearly 36%, fell within the 21 through 24 year-old category. 30 or older was second with a little over 28%. 18-20 year-olds represented about 24%, 25-29 year-olds were under 9% and the under 18 age group not even hitting 4% of the total respondents.\n\n\n\nOur final demographics question related to the highest level of educational attainment achieved. Matching perfectly with our under-18 group was no completion of high school. It can be assumed that this is because they’ve yet to reach the natural progression of their schooling to earn their high school diploma. Matching again with most of the ages being at or beyond college age, “some college or technical training” had the highest numbers, representing more than 43% of respondents. Close to 30% of respondents had earned a Bachelor’s Degree, then our numbers fell off dramatically with just a little over 12% having an advanced degree and 11% with a high school diploma/GED.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 discusses the knowledge of beverages of the participants. Well over half of the participants believe that they know some about beverages (61.7%). A third of the participants believe that they know a lot of beverage knowledge (30.9%). A small number of participants believe they know everything (3.7%) or they don’t know anything at all about beverages (3.7%).\n\n\nWe asked what level of knowledge our respondents had about the impact of drinking sugary drinks with the idea of being able to compare their answers with their behaviors surrounding sugary drinks. The hope is that someone who claims to have a high level of understanding would show they have low consumption of sugary drinks, but we thought it would be interesting if the opposite showed in our data as well. We broke the possible answers into 4 categories: I know everything, I know a lot, I know some, and I don’t know anything at all. Interestingly the same percentage of respondents (3.7%) answered on the two ends of the spectrum. 31% answered that they knew a lot, and more than 61% said they knew some. This graph shows public health officials have work to do in educating people about the impacts of sugary drinks.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 discusses the attitudes of participants towards beverages. 66% of participants said they believe water is a beverage of choice in a restaurant, leaving 34% believing that it is not a beverage of choice. Most of the participants are concerned about how sugary beverages can affect their health (60%). However, 40% of the participants are not concerned about how sugary beverages affect their health.\n\n\nWe wanted to know how people viewed water in comparison to other drink options. Our question gave options comparing it to soda, coffee, tea, etc. We had a total of 70 people who answered this write-in question and articulated a definitive yes or no response. Many of those then elaborated on why they answered the way they did. 66% responded that yes, water is in fact a beverage, while 34% answered that they did not consider it to be a beverage.\n\n\n\nThis question was related to our question about people’s views on their own knowledge level of sugary beverages. Our reasoning was that it should absolutely be a concern and we wanted to compare any possible “no” answers with someone who claimed to have a high level of knowledge about the impact of sugary drinks on their health. Of the 73 responses we got for this question 68 had answered the question with definitive yes or no answers. The other 5 put things like “N/A” or “water and sprite” which didn’t really make sense for what we were asking so we tossed them out. Of the 68 responses, 60% replied yes, while 40% did not have any concerns about sugary beverages relating to the impact on their health.\n\n\n\nIn Table 4, it was found that 42% of participants drink an average of 32-64 ounces of water daily and 30.9% drink an average of 16-32 ounces of water daily. There were a decent amount of participants drinking more than 64 ounces of water daily, 22.2%. A small percentage drink less than 16 ounces of water daily, 4.9%. About a third of participants drink sugary beverages several times a week, 31.3%, over a quarter of participants drink sugary beverages every day, 28.7%, 15% consume sugary beverages several times a month, 13.8% drink sugary beverages once a week, and lastly, 11.3% of the participants rarely or never consume drinks with added sugar. Looking at sugary beverage consumption, 54.3% of participants stated they drink less than 8 ounces of sweetened beverages daily, and 30.9% drink 8-16 ounces of sugary beverages daily. 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 1.2% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of sugary beverages every day. Not including water, a majority of persons drink less than 8 ounces of unsweetened beverages a day (51.9%), or 8-16 ounces a day (32.1%). 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 2.5% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of unsweetened beverages daily. Although our survey solely focused on sugar consumption, we did include a question regarding alcohol consumption. When asked about weekly alcohol consumption, a majority of participants either have less than 1 serving (35.0%) or 1-3 servings (26.3%) of alcohol a week. Less than a quarter of people do not consume any alcohol (20.0%). 16.2% of participants say they have 4-8 servings of alcohol a week, 1.2% have 9-14 servings of alcohol a week, and 1.2% have more than 14 savings of alcohol a week.\n\n\n\nTo gather information about certain behaviors with beverage choices we asked respondents to answer a question about their average daily water intake. To make it as clear as we could our answers had how many ounces and how many cups of water that was. For example, less than 16 oz or 2 cups was the first choice. Thankfully, that was our lowest result with less than 5% of respondents answering that category, but even 4.9% seems high considering that is less than one bottle of water each day. More than 64 oz or 8 cups represented the next highest response rate at a little over 22%. A common recommendation is to drink at least 8 cups of water each day, but this is a bit misleading as it doesn’t have to be pure water people are drinking to reach those levels so hopefully 5% of respondents are getting healthy fluid intake elsewhere. More than 30% of respondents answered they take in an average of 16-32 oz or 2-4 cups of water per day. 42% answered they drink between 32-64 oz or 4-8 cups of water per day on average.\n\n\n\nThe next couple of questions went hand in hand as we asked about how often, then the frequency of drinking beverages with added sugar. The first question asked on average how often do respondents consume drinks with added sugar. Every day and Several Times a Week were our top 2 answers with 29% and 31% respectively. Once a Week, Several Times a Month, and Rarely or Never were all significantly lower at 14%, 15%, and 11% respectively.\n\n\n\nThis question answered how much of a sugary beverage was being consumed. It went hand in hand with the previous question because if someone answered that they drank a sugary beverage every day, our hope was they’d at least be keeping the amount at low levels. Comparing the two graphs side by side shows that to be true with the overwhelming majority of respondents answering they drank less than 8 oz or 1 cup of a sweetened beverage each day. In fact, more than 54% of respondents drank that amount. 31% of respondents drank between 8-16 oz or 2-4 cups. Respondents didn’t even combine for 15% of the total who answered for the remaining 4 possible answers ranging from 16-32 oz, 32-48 oz, 48-64 oz, or More than 64 oz.\n\n\n\nWe specified in this question to not include water when answering about their unsweetened beverage consumption. That way we wouldn’t get a crossover of answers from the Daily Water Intake question that came in the survey before. Less than 8 oz represented more than half of all respondents at just under 52% of the total answers. 32% answered they consumed between 8-16 oz, and again seeing a steep dropoff to less than 9% drinking between 16-32 oz. Less than 5% drink between 32-48 oz and about half that number again at 2.5% reported drinking between 48-64 oz on a daily basis. Not one respondent answered they drank more than 64 oz each day. Considering the numbers for the amount of daily water intake were much higher, I expect that when people aren’t drinking sweetened beverages, they are choosing to drink water.\n\n\n\nLastly, even though the main purpose of our survey was about sugary beverages we wanted to have at least one question about how many servings of alcoholic beverages people were drinking on average. That’s not to say that many if not most alcoholic beverages contain sugar, but due to them being regulated by a different governmental agency, alcoholic beverages are not required by law to give their nutritional facts. Our question therefore wasn’t about the sugar content because that would be too hard for most people to figure out or know offhand about, rather we defined what a serving of alcohol was and then asked how many servings per week on average respondents were drinking. A serving is defined as 1.5 oz of hard liquor, 5 oz of wine, and/or 12 oz of beer. We were also careful in how we broke down our serving ranges. Possible answers were: none, less than 1 serving, 1-3 servings, 4-8 servings, 9-14 servings, and more than 14 servings. It is recommended that women not drink more than 3 drinks in a day or more than 7 drinks per week, while it is recommended that men not drink more than 4 drinks in a day or 14 per week. We did not explain this in our survey, but wanted the options to have breakdowns that fit with those guidelines. Meaning we didn’t want our high end to be more than 12 drinks per week (which it was at one point in our drafts) because respondents could be in that category, but there’d be no way for us to know if they were beyond the weekly recommended or not. 35% of respondents answered that they consumed less than 1 serving of alcohol per week. 26% between 1-3 servings, 20% answered they didn’t drink any servings at all, and 16% responded they consumed between 4-8 servings. 1.2% which equaled 1 respondent total said they drank between 9-14 servings and another said they drank more than 14 servings per week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of gender identity, we found that the most prevalent response, accounting for nearly 60% of participants, was cisgender female. Turning to age, our findings indicated that the age range of 21-24 had the highest representation, comprising 36% of respondents. This suggests that college-age students were the most likely to have either received or responded to our survey. As for educational attainment, the results aligned with the age range findings, as “some college or technical training” was the most common level of education reported by over 43% of participants, given the substantial portion within the typical college age range. When asked about one’s knowledge of the health impacts of drinking sugary beverages, the majority of the responses ranged in the “I know a lot” answer (31%) and the “I knew some’’ response (61%) instigating the need for more education within this area. We wanted to collect qualitative data asking individuals to provide their point of view as to whether or not they have any concerns about the impact of sugary beverages on their health. As the group had initially assumed would happen, the majority (60%) of the 68 definitive responses to this question were yes. These concerns ranged anywhere from actual sugar intake concerns in the diet to concerns about medical implications such as high blood pressure. It lets us know that people are definitely aware of the impacts but there is also room for growth. This is a great opportunity for changes to begin at an organizational or community level since we found that our biggest demographic group was females within the college age range. Regarding daily water intake, the most common response, accounting for 42% of participants, indicated an average intake of 16-32 oz of water per day. This data may be slightly misconstrued because we did not clarify that other beverages contained water and could be counted in this response so people may have only been thinking about their pure water intake rate. As a result, participants might have focused solely on their pure water intake rate. Moving on to daily sweetened beverage consumption, we were pleased to find that the majority of respondents (54%) consumed less than 8 oz of sweetened beverages per day, followed by 31% reporting consumption between 8-16 oz. This suggests that many participants understand the recommendation to limit their daily intake of sugary beverages. Regarding daily unsweetened beverage consumption, we obtained similarly positive results. The majority of respondents (52%) reported consuming less than 8 oz of unsweetened beverages per day, with the second-highest category (32%) falling within the 8-16 oz range. This indicates that when considering daily water intake, individuals are opting for water when they are not consuming sweetened beverages. Moving on to the question on weekly alcohol consumption, although our alcohol question did not relate directly to sugar intake we felt it was important to consider what people were drinking as another option instead of water. In conclusion, our behavior findings shed light on the respondents’ attitudes and choices regarding beverage consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Table 1, Figure 1: Demographics Which of the following most closely matches your highest level of education? No completion of high school education 3.7% (3 respondents) High school diploma/GED 11.1% (9 respondents) Some college or technical training 43.2% (35 respondents) Bachelor’s degree 29.6% (25 respondents) Advanced Degree 12.3% (10 respondents)\nReference Table 1, Figure 2: What is your gender identity?

Exemplar Quote: “Yes, even though it is not a sweet beverage. But I still consider it being a beverage since it is something that one can enjoy and drink.”\nTheme 2: Many respondents do not consider water as a beverage of choice when ordering at a restaurant. Exemplar Quote: “No, because water does not show up on the menu like soda, coffee, and tea do. Also, you don’t have to pay for water at a restaurant, but you do have to pay for other drinks.”\nTheme 3: Many respondents order water and another beverage when at a restaurant. Exemplar Quote: “I usually always get water and something else to drink as well.”\nReference Table 2, Figure 6: Q: Do you have any concerns relating to the impact of sugary beverages on your health? Please explain.\nTheme 1: Most respondents do have concerns about the impact of sugary beverages. Exemplar Quote: “Yes, I worry about the effect on my bodily health, particularly dental health when drinking sugary beverages.”\nTheme 2: There were many respondents who were not concerned about the impact of sugary beverages on their health. Exemplar Quote: “I am not concerned with the impact of the sugary beverages because I don’t think I consume enough of them for it to be bad for my health.”\nTheme 3: Some respondents said they know it has poor impacts on their health, but they are not concerned about it. Exemplar Quote: “The Dutch rebels really are fueling my sugar addiction but at this rate it’s like a reward :).”."

    "text": "I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to explore a wide range of industries that have captured my interest. My work experience began with a three-year stint at a fast-food restaurant, where I learned the value of loyalty and dedication. In between those three years, I worked as a tutor at a local middle school, hoping to explore a career in education and later as an intern at the Oregon Environmental Council to pursue my interest in environmental justice.\nFollowing my internship, I worked as an oral health educator assistant at the Boys & Girls Club, Health and Dental Services Center. I loved being in scrubs every day and felt like I was making a personal difference in the lives of the students we served. This experience led me to pursue a career in oral healthcare, where I provided chairside dental care as a dental assistant. However, during the pandemic, I began feeling burnt out and decided to return to community college to fulfill necessary prerequisites for dental school.\nWhile I was unsure of my next step, I made the difficult decision to leave my dental assisting job after thoughtful consideration. I then spent three months in Mexico connecting with my roots. It was during this time that I received an email informing me that I had been awarded a scholarship that would cover my tuition and allow me to transfer to Western Oregon University. It was here that I fell in love with my public health education classes, and shortly after my first term, I declared myself a public health major.\nThroughout my professional journey, I have honed my skills in communication, easily adapting to new environments, and taking on leadership roles with enthusiasm. Public speaking has been a consistent part of many of my positions, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. I am excited to continue growing and learning in my future endeavors."

    "text": "A survey was created in Google Forms, made up of 10 multiple choice questions and 2 short answer questions. Our group gathered questions from previous questionnaires from reliable sources that specifically addressed nutrition and health concerns. Initially, each member contributed 12 questions each, and together we refined and narrowed them down to a final set of 12 questions total. Additionally, we made necessary adjustments to ensure that the wording of the questions was easily understandable for respondents. All these questions were put in a Google Document and cited the data that was pulled from other professional surveys. All of the information from the Google Document was inputted directly into a Google Form, the initial survey instrument was edited and put through a test run by our own group members before it was finalized by the Google Form coordinator. We had to collect a minimum of 50 responses. Each member took responsibility for sharing the Google Form link to ensure that we reached and exceeded the minimum response goal. The survey was open from May 5, 2023, and closed on May 7, 2023. After giving our respondents five days to complete the survey, we received 82 total responses, but one of those 82 did not agree to the initial consent form. Overall, a total of 81 individuals participated in our survey, their responses were collected and provided important information to make our conclusions."

    "text": "![Figure 3.D.iii.2](Figure_3D_iii_2%20Large.jpeg)\nTable 1 discusses the demographic characteristics of the participants in the survey. The questions were answered similarly. Over half of the participants identified as Cisgender Female (58.7%). One-third of the participants identified as Cisgender Male (30.0%). There was a small number of persons identified as Non-Binary (3.7%) and Transgender Female (1.2%). There was also a small percentage of people who did not say what their gender identity is (6.3%). A majority of people were in the age ranges of 21-24 (35.8%), 30 or older (28.4%) or 18-20 (23.5%). 8.6% of participants were between the ages of 25-29 and 3.7% of participants were under the age of 18. This table also discusses the education levels. A majority of the participants had completed some college or technical training (43.2%) or a completion of a Bachelor’s degree (29.6%). 11.1% of participants had a completion of a High School Diploma or a GED and 12.3% have an Advanced Degree. A very small percentage of participants had no completion of high school (3.7%).\n\n\nTo start our survey we asked a few questions regarding our respondents’ demographics. We asked them to answer which gender identity they identified as. We specifically asked about gender identity rather than sex because people identify more than what sex they were assigned at birth and felt by giving more options than simply male or female, we were able to be inclusive to everyone participating in our survey. The majority of respondents were cisgender females representing nearly 60% of our survey. Cisgender males represented 30%, with the remaining being made up of either transgender females, non-binary, or people who would rather not say.\n\n\n\nWe also wanted to get the age of those participating in our survey. We offered several age ranges with a conscious decision to group those below and those over the age of 21 into different categories knowing we would be asking a question regarding alcohol consumption in our survey. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of our respondents, accounting for nearly 36%, fell within the 21 through 24 year-old category. 30 or older was second with a little over 28%. 18-20 year-olds represented about 24%, 25-29 year-olds were under 9% and the under 18 age group not even hitting 4% of the total respondents.\n\n\n\nOur final demographics question related to the highest level of educational attainment achieved. Matching perfectly with our under-18 group was no completion of high school. It can be assumed that this is because they’ve yet to reach the natural progression of their schooling to earn their high school diploma. Matching again with most of the ages being at or beyond college age, “some college or technical training” had the highest numbers, representing more than 43% of respondents. Close to 30% of respondents had earned a Bachelor’s Degree, then our numbers fell off dramatically with just a little over 12% having an advanced degree and 11% with a high school diploma/GED."

The hope is that someone who claims to have a high level of understanding would show they have low consumption of sugary drinks, but we thought it would be interesting if the opposite showed in our data as well. We broke the possible answers into 4 categories: I know everything, I know a lot, I know some, and I don’t know anything at all. Interestingly the same percentage of respondents (3.7%) answered on the two ends of the spectrum. 31% answered that they knew a lot, and more than 61% said they knew some.

A serving is defined as 1.5 oz of hard liquor, 5 oz of wine, and/or 12 oz of beer. We were also careful in how we broke down our serving ranges. Possible answers were: none, less than 1 serving, 1-3 servings, 4-8 servings, 9-14 servings, and more than 14 servings. It is recommended that women not drink more than 3 drinks in a day or more than 7 drinks per week, while it is recommended that men not drink more than 4 drinks in a day or 14 per week. We did not explain this in our survey, but wanted the options to have breakdowns that fit with those guidelines. Meaning we didn’t want our high end to be more than 12 drinks per week (which it was at one point in our drafts) because respondents could be in that category, but there’d be no way for us to know if they were beyond the weekly recommended or not. 35% of respondents answered that they consumed less than 1 serving of alcohol per week. 26% between 1-3 servings, 20% answered they didn’t drink any servings at all, and 16% responded they consumed between 4-8 servings. 1.2% which equaled 1 respondent total said they drank between 9-14 servings and another said they drank more than 14 servings per week."

    "text": "In terms of gender identity, we found that the most prevalent response, accounting for nearly 60% of participants, was cisgender female. Turning to age, our findings indicated that the age range of 21-24 had the highest representation, comprising 36% of respondents. This suggests that college-age students were the most likely to have either received or responded to our survey. As for educational attainment, the results aligned with the age range findings, as “some college or technical training” was the most common level of education reported by over 43% of participants, given the substantial portion within the typical college age range. When asked about one’s knowledge of the health impacts of drinking sugary beverages, the majority of the responses ranged in the “I know a lot” answer (31%) and the “I knew some’’ response (61%) instigating the need for more education within this area. We wanted to collect qualitative data asking individuals to provide their point of view as to whether or not they have any concerns about the impact of sugary beverages on their health. As the group had initially assumed would happen, the majority (60%) of the 68 definitive responses to this question were yes. These concerns ranged anywhere from actual sugar intake concerns in the diet to concerns about medical implications such as high blood pressure. It lets us know that people are definitely aware of the impacts but there is also room for growth. This is a great opportunity for changes to begin at an organizational or community level since we found that our biggest demographic group was females within the college age range. Regarding daily water intake, the most common response, accounting for 42% of participants, indicated an average intake of 16-32 oz of water per day. This data may be slightly misconstrued because we did not clarify that other beverages contained water and could be counted in this response so people may have only been thinking about their pure water intake rate. As a result, participants might have focused solely on their pure water intake rate. Moving on to daily sweetened beverage consumption, we were pleased to find that the majority of respondents (54%) consumed less than 8 oz of sweetened beverages per day, followed by 31% reporting consumption between 8-16 oz. This suggests that many participants understand the recommendation to limit their daily intake of sugary beverages. Regarding daily unsweetened beverage consumption, we obtained similarly positive results. The majority of respondents (52%) reported consuming less than 8 oz of unsweetened beverages per day, with the second-highest category (32%) falling within the 8-16 oz range. This indicates that when considering daily water intake, individuals are opting for water when they are not consuming sweetened beverages. Moving on to the question on weekly alcohol consumption, although our alcohol question did not relate directly to sugar intake we felt it was important to consider what people were drinking as another option instead of water. In conclusion, our behavior findings shed light on the respondents’ attitudes and choices regarding beverage consumption."

    "text": "To better understand the consumption of sugary beverages in our community and assess nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to these drinks, a total of 12 questions were asked to participants. The survey included a variety of questions relating to demographic circumstances, mainly pertaining to age, educational attainment, and gender identity. Our research group, consisting of five members, looked at potential reasons why a person might choose the beverage they do. We also looked into how often the respondents drank sweetened versus unsweetened beverages so that we could understand sugar consumption. This kind of information that was gathered is important because it shows us the relationship that different age groups have with sugary beverages compared to water and how it affects what they drink. We could use this information to provide educational opportunities around beverages and the importance of understanding the effects of sugary drinks.\n\n\n\nA survey was created in Google Forms, made up of 10 multiple choice questions and 2 short answer questions. Our group gathered questions from previous questionnaires from reliable sources that specifically addressed nutrition and health concerns. Initially, each member contributed 12 questions each, and together we refined and narrowed them down to a final set of 12 questions total. Additionally, we made necessary adjustments to ensure that the wording of the questions was easily understandable for respondents. All these questions were put in a Google Document and cited the data that was pulled from other professional surveys. All of the information from the Google Document was inputted directly into a Google Form, the initial survey instrument was edited and put through a test run by our own group members before it was finalized by the Google Form coordinator. We had to collect a minimum of 50 responses. Each member took responsibility for sharing the Google Form link to ensure that we reached and exceeded the minimum response goal. The survey was open from May 5, 2023, and closed on May 7, 2023. After giving our respondents five days to complete the survey, we received 82 total responses, but one of those 82 did not agree to the initial consent form. Overall, a total of 81 individuals participated in our survey, their responses were collected and provided important information to make our conclusions.\n\n\n\n![Figure 3.D.iii.2](Figure_3D_iii_2%20Large.jpeg)\nTable 1 discusses the demographic characteristics of the participants in the survey. The questions were answered similarly. Over half of the participants identified as Cisgender Female (58.7%). One-third of the participants identified as Cisgender Male (30.0%). There was a small number of persons identified as Non-Binary (3.7%) and Transgender Female (1.2%). There was also a small percentage of people who did not say what their gender identity is (6.3%). A majority of people were in the age ranges of 21-24 (35.8%), 30 or older (28.4%) or 18-20 (23.5%). 8.6% of participants were between the ages of 25-29 and 3.7% of participants were under the age of 18. This table also discusses the education levels. A majority of the participants had completed some college or technical training (43.2%) or a completion of a Bachelor’s degree (29.6%). 11.1% of participants had a completion of a High School Diploma or a GED and 12.3% have an Advanced Degree. A very small percentage of participants had no completion of high school (3.7%).\n\n\nTo start our survey we asked a few questions regarding our respondents’ demographics. We asked them to answer which gender identity they identified as. We specifically asked about gender identity rather than sex because people identify more than what sex they were assigned at birth and felt by giving more options than simply male or female, we were able to be inclusive to everyone participating in our survey. The majority of respondents were cisgender females representing nearly 60% of our survey. Cisgender males represented 30%, with the remaining being made up of either transgender females, non-binary, or people who would rather not say.\n\n\n\nWe also wanted to get the age of those participating in our survey. We offered several age ranges with a conscious decision to group those below and those over the age of 21 into different categories knowing we would be asking a question regarding alcohol consumption in our survey. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of our respondents, accounting for nearly 36%, fell within the 21 through 24 year-old category. 30 or older was second with a little over 28%. 18-20 year-olds represented about 24%, 25-29 year-olds were under 9% and the under 18 age group not even hitting 4% of the total respondents.\n\n\n\nOur final demographics question related to the highest level of educational attainment achieved. Matching perfectly with our under-18 group was no completion of high school. It can be assumed that this is because they’ve yet to reach the natural progression of their schooling to earn their high school diploma. Matching again with most of the ages being at or beyond college age, “some college or technical training” had the highest numbers, representing more than 43% of respondents. Close to 30% of respondents had earned a Bachelor’s Degree, then our numbers fell off dramatically with just a little over 12% having an advanced degree and 11% with a high school diploma/GED.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 discusses the knowledge of beverages of the participants. Well over half of the participants believe that they know some about beverages (61.7%). A third of the participants believe that they know a lot of beverage knowledge (30.9%). A small number of participants believe they know everything (3.7%) or they don’t know anything at all about beverages (3.7%).\n\n\nWe asked what level of knowledge our respondents had about the impact of drinking sugary drinks with the idea of being able to compare their answers with their behaviors surrounding sugary drinks. The hope is that someone who claims to have a high level of understanding would show they have low consumption of sugary drinks, but we thought it would be interesting if the opposite showed in our data as well. We broke the possible answers into 4 categories: I know everything, I know a lot, I know some, and I don’t know anything at all. Interestingly the same percentage of respondents (3.7%) answered on the two ends of the spectrum. 31% answered that they knew a lot, and more than 61% said they knew some. This graph shows public health officials have work to do in educating people about the impacts of sugary drinks.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 discusses the attitudes of participants towards beverages. 66% of participants said they believe water is a beverage of choice in a restaurant, leaving 34% believing that it is not a beverage of choice. Most of the participants are concerned about how sugary beverages can affect their health (60%). However, 40% of the participants are not concerned about how sugary beverages affect their health.\n\n\nWe wanted to know how people viewed water in comparison to other drink options. Our question gave options comparing it to soda, coffee, tea, etc. We had a total of 70 people who answered this write-in question and articulated a definitive yes or no response. Many of those then elaborated on why they answered the way they did. 66% responded that yes, water is in fact a beverage, while 34% answered that they did not consider it to be a beverage.\n\n\n\nThis question was related to our question about people’s views on their own knowledge level of sugary beverages. Our reasoning was that it should absolutely be a concern and we wanted to compare any possible “no” answers with someone who claimed to have a high level of knowledge about the impact of sugary drinks on their health. Of the 73 responses we got for this question 68 had answered the question with definitive yes or no answers. The other 5 put things like “N/A” or “water and sprite” which didn’t really make sense for what we were asking so we tossed them out. Of the 68 responses, 60% replied yes, while 40% did not have any concerns about sugary beverages relating to the impact on their health.\n\n\n\nIn Table 4, it was found that 42% of participants drink an average of 32-64 ounces of water daily and 30.9% drink an average of 16-32 ounces of water daily. There were a decent amount of participants drinking more than 64 ounces of water daily, 22.2%. A small percentage drink less than 16 ounces of water daily, 4.9%. About a third of participants drink sugary beverages several times a week, 31.3%, over a quarter of participants drink sugary beverages every day, 28.7%, 15% consume sugary beverages several times a month, 13.8% drink sugary beverages once a week, and lastly, 11.3% of the participants rarely or never consume drinks with added sugar. Looking at sugary beverage consumption, 54.3% of participants stated they drink less than 8 ounces of sweetened beverages daily, and 30.9% drink 8-16 ounces of sugary beverages daily. 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 1.2% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of sugary beverages every day. Not including water, a majority of persons drink less than 8 ounces of unsweetened beverages a day (51.9%), or 8-16 ounces a day (32.1%). 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 2.5% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of unsweetened beverages daily. Although our survey solely focused on sugar consumption, we did include a question regarding alcohol consumption. When asked about weekly alcohol consumption, a majority of participants either have less than 1 serving (35.0%) or 1-3 servings (26.3%) of alcohol a week. Less than a quarter of people do not consume any alcohol (20.0%). 16.2% of participants say they have 4-8 servings of alcohol a week, 1.2% have 9-14 servings of alcohol a week, and 1.2% have more than 14 savings of alcohol a week.\n\n\n\nTo gather information about certain behaviors with beverage choices we asked respondents to answer a question about their average daily water intake. To make it as clear as we could our answers had how many ounces and how many cups of water that was. For example, less than 16 oz or 2 cups was the first choice. Thankfully, that was our lowest result with less than 5% of respondents answering that category, but even 4.9% seems high considering that is less than one bottle of water each day. More than 64 oz or 8 cups represented the next highest response rate at a little over 22%. A common recommendation is to drink at least 8 cups of water each day, but this is a bit misleading as it doesn’t have to be pure water people are drinking to reach those levels so hopefully 5% of respondents are getting healthy fluid intake elsewhere. More than 30% of respondents answered they take in an average of 16-32 oz or 2-4 cups of water per day. 42% answered they drink between 32-64 oz or 4-8 cups of water per day on average.\n\n\n\nThe next couple of questions went hand in hand as we asked about how often, then the frequency of drinking beverages with added sugar. The first question asked on average how often do respondents consume drinks with added sugar. Every day and Several Times a Week were our top 2 answers with 29% and 31% respectively. Once a Week, Several Times a Month, and Rarely or Never were all significantly lower at 14%, 15%, and 11% respectively.\n\n\n\nThis question answered how much of a sugary beverage was being consumed. It went hand in hand with the previous question because if someone answered that they drank a sugary beverage every day, our hope was they’d at least be keeping the amount at low levels. Comparing the two graphs side by side shows that to be true with the overwhelming majority of respondents answering they drank less than 8 oz or 1 cup of a sweetened beverage each day. In fact, more than 54% of respondents drank that amount. 31% of respondents drank between 8-16 oz or 2-4 cups. Respondents didn’t even combine for 15% of the total who answered for the remaining 4 possible answers ranging from 16-32 oz, 32-48 oz, 48-64 oz, or More than 64 oz.\n\n\n\nWe specified in this question to not include water when answering about their unsweetened beverage consumption. That way we wouldn’t get a crossover of answers from the Daily Water Intake question that came in the survey before. Less than 8 oz represented more than half of all respondents at just under 52% of the total answers. 32% answered they consumed between 8-16 oz, and again seeing a steep dropoff to less than 9% drinking between 16-32 oz. Less than 5% drink between 32-48 oz and about half that number again at 2.5% reported drinking between 48-64 oz on a daily basis. Not one respondent answered they drank more than 64 oz each day. Considering the numbers for the amount of daily water intake were much higher, I expect that when people aren’t drinking sweetened beverages, they are choosing to drink water.\n\n\n\nLastly, even though the main purpose of our survey was about sugary beverages we wanted to have at least one question about how many servings of alcoholic beverages people were drinking on average. That’s not to say that many if not most alcoholic beverages contain sugar, but due to them being regulated by a different governmental agency, alcoholic beverages are not required by law to give their nutritional facts. Our question therefore wasn’t about the sugar content because that would be too hard for most people to figure out or know offhand about, rather we defined what a serving of alcohol was and then asked how many servings per week on average respondents were drinking. A serving is defined as 1.5 oz of hard liquor, 5 oz of wine, and/or 12 oz of beer. We were also careful in how we broke down our serving ranges. Possible answers were: none, less than 1 serving, 1-3 servings, 4-8 servings, 9-14 servings, and more than 14 servings. It is recommended that women not drink more than 3 drinks in a day or more than 7 drinks per week, while it is recommended that men not drink more than 4 drinks in a day or 14 per week. We did not explain this in our survey, but wanted the options to have breakdowns that fit with those guidelines. Meaning we didn’t want our high end to be more than 12 drinks per week (which it was at one point in our drafts) because respondents could be in that category, but there’d be no way for us to know if they were beyond the weekly recommended or not. 35% of respondents answered that they consumed less than 1 serving of alcohol per week. 26% between 1-3 servings, 20% answered they didn’t drink any servings at all, and 16% responded they consumed between 4-8 servings. 1.2% which equaled 1 respondent total said they drank between 9-14 servings and another said they drank more than 14 servings per week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of gender identity, we found that the most prevalent response, accounting for nearly 60% of participants, was cisgender female. Turning to age, our findings indicated that the age range of 21-24 had the highest representation, comprising 36% of respondents. This suggests that college-age students were the most likely to have either received or responded to our survey.

A very small percentage of participants had no completion of high school (3.7%).\n\n\nTo start our survey we asked a few questions regarding our respondents’ demographics. We asked them to answer which gender identity they identified as. We specifically asked about gender identity rather than sex because people identify more than what sex they were assigned at birth and felt by giving more options than simply male or female, we were able to be inclusive to everyone participating in our survey. The majority of respondents were cisgender females representing nearly 60% of our survey. Cisgender males represented 30%, with the remaining being made up of either transgender females, non-binary, or people who would rather not say.\n\n\n\nWe also wanted to get the age of those participating in our survey. We offered several age ranges with a conscious decision to group those below and those over the age of 21 into different categories knowing we would be asking a question regarding alcohol consumption in our survey. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of our respondents, accounting for nearly 36%, fell within the 21 through 24 year-old category. 30 or older was second with a little over 28%. 18-20 year-olds represented about 24%, 25-29 year-olds were under 9% and the under 18 age group not even hitting 4% of the total respondents.\n\n\n\nOur final demographics question related to the highest level of educational attainment achieved. Matching perfectly with our under-18 group was no completion of high school. It can be assumed that this is because they’ve yet to reach the natural progression of their schooling to earn their high school diploma. Matching again with most of the ages being at or beyond college age, “some college or technical training” had the highest numbers, representing more than 43% of respondents. Close to 30% of respondents had earned a Bachelor’s Degree, then our numbers fell off dramatically with just a little over 12% having an advanced degree and 11% with a high school diploma/GED."

    "text": "Table 2 discusses the knowledge of beverages of the participants. Well over half of the participants believe that they know some about beverages (61.7%). A third of the participants believe that they know a lot of beverage knowledge (30.9%). A small number of participants believe they know everything (3.7%) or they don’t know anything at all about beverages (3.7%).\n\n\nWe asked what level of knowledge our respondents had about the impact of drinking sugary drinks with the idea of being able to compare their answers with their behaviors surrounding sugary drinks. The hope is that someone who claims to have a high level of understanding would show they have low consumption of sugary drinks, but we thought it would be interesting if the opposite showed in our data as well. We broke the possible answers into 4 categories: I know everything, I know a lot, I know some, and I don’t know anything at all. Interestingly the same percentage of respondents (3.7%) answered on the two ends of the spectrum. 31% answered that they knew a lot, and more than 61% said they knew some. This graph shows public health officials have work to do in educating people about the impacts of sugary drinks."

    "text": "Table 3 discusses the attitudes of participants towards beverages. 66% of participants said they believe water is a beverage of choice in a restaurant, leaving 34% believing that it is not a beverage of choice. Most of the participants are concerned about how sugary beverages can affect their health (60%). However, 40% of the participants are not concerned about how sugary beverages affect their health.\n\n\nWe wanted to know how people viewed water in comparison to other drink options. Our question gave options comparing it to soda, coffee, tea, etc. We had a total of 70 people who answered this write-in question and articulated a definitive yes or no response. Many of those then elaborated on why they answered the way they did. 66% responded that yes, water is in fact a beverage, while 34% answered that they did not consider it to be a beverage.\n\n\n\nThis question was related to our question about people’s views on their own knowledge level of sugary beverages. Our reasoning was that it should absolutely be a concern and we wanted to compare any possible “no” answers with someone who claimed to have a high level of knowledge about the impact of sugary drinks on their health. Of the 73 responses we got for this question 68 had answered the question with definitive yes or no answers. The other 5 put things like “N/A” or “water and sprite” which didn’t really make sense for what we were asking so we tossed them out. Of the 68 responses, 60% replied yes, while 40% did not have any concerns about sugary beverages relating to the impact on their health.\n\n\n\nIn Table 4, it was found that 42% of participants drink an average of 32-64 ounces of water daily and 30.9% drink an average of 16-32 ounces of water daily. There were a decent amount of participants drinking more than 64 ounces of water daily, 22.2%. A small percentage drink less than 16 ounces of water daily, 4.9%. About a third of participants drink sugary beverages several times a week, 31.3%, over a quarter of participants drink sugary beverages every day, 28.7%, 15% consume sugary beverages several times a month, 13.8% drink sugary beverages once a week, and lastly, 11.3% of the participants rarely or never consume drinks with added sugar. Looking at sugary beverage consumption, 54.3% of participants stated they drink less than 8 ounces of sweetened beverages daily, and 30.9% drink 8-16 ounces of sugary beverages daily. 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 1.2% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of sugary beverages every day. Not including water, a majority of persons drink less than 8 ounces of unsweetened beverages a day (51.9%), or 8-16 ounces a day (32.1%). 8.6% drink 16-32 ounces, 4.9% drink 32-48 ounces, 2.5% drink 48-64 ounces, and 0.0% drink more than 64 ounces of unsweetened beverages daily. Although our survey solely focused on sugar consumption, we did include a question regarding alcohol consumption. When asked about weekly alcohol consumption, a majority of participants either have less than 1 serving (35.0%) or 1-3 servings (26.3%) of alcohol a week. Less than a quarter of people do not consume any alcohol (20.0%). 16.2% of participants say they have 4-8 servings of alcohol a week, 1.2% have 9-14 servings of alcohol a week, and 1.2% have more than 14 savings of alcohol a week.\n\n\n\nTo gather information about certain behaviors with beverage choices we asked respondents to answer a question about their average daily water intake. To make it as clear as we could our answers had how many ounces and how many cups of water that was. For example, less than 16 oz or 2 cups was the first choice. Thankfully, that was our lowest result with less than 5% of respondents answering that category, but even 4.9% seems high considering that is less than one bottle of water each day. More than 64 oz or 8 cups represented the next highest response rate at a little over 22%. A common recommendation is to drink at least 8 cups of water each day, but this is a bit misleading as it doesn’t have to be pure water people are drinking to reach those levels so hopefully 5% of respondents are getting healthy fluid intake elsewhere. More than 30% of respondents answered they take in an average of 16-32 oz or 2-4 cups of water per day. 42% answered they drink between 32-64 oz or 4-8 cups of water per day on average.\n\n\n\nThe next couple of questions went hand in hand as we asked about how often, then the frequency of drinking beverages with added sugar. The first question asked on average how often do respondents consume drinks with added sugar. Every day and Several Times a Week were our top 2 answers with 29% and 31% respectively. Once a Week, Several Times a Month, and Rarely or Never were all significantly lower at 14%, 15%, and 11% respectively.\n\n\n\nThis question answered how much of a sugary beverage was being consumed. It went hand in hand with the previous question because if someone answered that they drank a sugary beverage every day, our hope was they’d at least be keeping the amount at low levels. Comparing the two graphs side by side shows that to be true with the overwhelming majority of respondents answering they drank less than 8 oz or 1 cup of a sweetened beverage each day. In fact, more than 54% of respondents drank that amount. 31% of respondents drank between 8-16 oz or 2-4 cups. Respondents didn’t even combine for 15% of the total who answered for the remaining 4 possible answers ranging from 16-32 oz, 32-48 oz, 48-64 oz, or More than 64 oz.\n\n\n\nWe specified in this question to not include water when answering about their unsweetened beverage consumption. That way we wouldn’t get a crossover of answers from the Daily Water Intake question that came in the survey before. Less than 8 oz represented more than half of all respondents at just under 52% of the total answers. 32% answered they consumed between 8-16 oz, and again seeing a steep dropoff to less than 9% drinking between 16-32 oz. Less than 5% drink between 32-48 oz and about half that number again at 2.5% reported drinking between 48-64 oz on a daily basis. Not one respondent answered they drank more than 64 oz each day. Considering the numbers for the amount of daily water intake were much higher, I expect that when people aren’t drinking sweetened beverages, they are choosing to drink water.\n\n\n\nLastly, even though the main purpose of our survey was about sugary beverages we wanted to have at least one question about how many servings of alcoholic beverages people were drinking on average. That’s not to say that many if not most alcoholic beverages contain sugar, but due to them being regulated by a different governmental agency, alcoholic beverages are not required by law to give their nutritional facts. Our question therefore wasn’t about the sugar content because that would be too hard for most people to figure out or know offhand about, rather we defined what a serving of alcohol was and then asked how many servings per week on average respondents were drinking. A serving is defined as 1.5 oz of hard liquor, 5 oz of wine, and/or 12 oz of beer. We were also careful in how we broke down our serving ranges. Possible answers were: none, less than 1 serving, 1-3 servings, 4-8 servings, 9-14 servings, and more than 14 servings. It is recommended that women not drink more than 3 drinks in a day or more than 7 drinks per week, while it is recommended that men not drink more than 4 drinks in a day or 14 per week. We did not explain this in our survey, but wanted the options to have breakdowns that fit with those guidelines. Meaning we didn’t want our high end to be more than 12 drinks per week (which it was at one point in our drafts) because respondents could be in that category, but there’d be no way for us to know if they were beyond the weekly recommended or not. 35% of respondents answered that they consumed less than 1 serving of alcohol per week. 26% between 1-3 servings, 20% answered they didn’t drink any servings at all, and 16% responded they consumed between 4-8 servings. 1.2% which equaled 1 respondent total said they drank between 9-14 servings and another said they drank more than 14 servings per week."

    "text": "In terms of gender identity, we found that the most prevalent response, accounting for nearly 60% of participants, was cisgender female. Turning to age, our findings indicated that the age range of 21-24 had the highest representation, comprising 36% of respondents. This suggests that college-age students were the most likely to have either received or responded to our survey. As for educational attainment, the results aligned with the age range findings, as “some college or technical training” was the most common level of education reported by over 43% of participants, given the substantial portion within the typical college age range. When asked about one’s knowledge of the health impacts of drinking sugary beverages, the majority of the responses ranged in the “I know a lot” answer (31%) and the “I knew some’’ response (61%) instigating the need for more education within this area. We wanted to collect qualitative data asking individuals to provide their point of view as to whether or not they have any concerns about the impact of sugary beverages on their health. As the group had initially assumed would happen, the majority (60%) of the 68 definitive responses to this question were yes. These concerns ranged anywhere from actual sugar intake concerns in the diet to concerns about medical implications such as high blood pressure. It lets us know that people are definitely aware of the impacts but there is also room for growth. This is a great opportunity for changes to begin at an organizational or community level since we found that our biggest demographic group was females within the college age range. Regarding daily water intake, the most common response, accounting for 42% of participants, indicated an average intake of 16-32 oz of water per day. This data may be slightly misconstrued because we did not clarify that other beverages contained water and could be counted in this response so people may have only been thinking about their pure water intake rate. As a result, participants might have focused solely on their pure water intake rate. Moving on to daily sweetened beverage consumption, we were pleased to find that the majority of respondents (54%) consumed less than 8 oz of sweetened beverages per day, followed by 31% reporting consumption between 8-16 oz. This suggests that many participants understand the recommendation to limit their daily intake of sugary beverages. Regarding daily unsweetened beverage consumption, we obtained similarly positive results. The majority of respondents (52%) reported consuming less than 8 oz of unsweetened beverages per day, with the second-highest category (32%) falling within the 8-16 oz range. This indicates that when considering daily water intake, individuals are opting for water when they are not consuming sweetened beverages. Moving on to the question on weekly alcohol consumption, although our alcohol question did not relate directly to sugar intake we felt it was important to consider what people were drinking as another option instead of water. In conclusion, our behavior findings shed light on the respondents’ attitudes and choices regarding beverage consumption."
