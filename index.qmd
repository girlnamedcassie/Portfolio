## WHO AM I?

As I continue practicing what I plan to preach someday, I am committed to stay up-to-date with the latest achievements in the public health industry, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches to inform decision-making and improve health outcomes for individuals and communities. I love chatting with folks about their wellness habits and how they approach the 8 dimensions of wellness. If I’m not talking to someone then I’m most likely updating my social media with posts of my latest travels with my sister, restaurant experiences with my parents, and unwinding with my friends. I have a keen interest in technology and innovation but also cherish the serenity of unplugging on a camping trip along the Oregon coast enjoying a nice warm cup of tea around the campfire while my family sips on their coffee.

## WHERE DO I COME FROM?

I was born in Silverton, Oregon, a small town located near the state capital of Salem. During my childhood, I lived in Keizer, Oregon, and for the past few years, I've been residing in Salem, which is less than 4 miles away. It wasn't until I grew older that I realized the significant demographic differences between Keizer and Salem. As I learned more about the area, I became more aware of the social and economic challenges faced by many families in the northeast side of Salem. Currently, I'm spending most of my time in Monmouth, a smaller city located west of Salem, where I'm completing my bachelor's degree.
